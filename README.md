# Implementing an inverted index :metal:

This project is about implementing an inverted index using Apache Spark for building the
index and a relational database (e.g. SQLite) for storing the index. We are using Python (PySpark) for this project. Storing the index in a database offers the benefit of using the B-Tree data structure offered by a relational database instead of building it from the scratch. 


## What we are doing :cloud:
1. Build the index using a document collection. <br>
2. Create database tables for storing the inverted index. <br>
3. Implement the keyword search functionality. <br>
4. Implement result ranking using the TF-IDF measure. <br>
5. Implement a simple interface for giving keyword queries and showing results. <br>


## Packages and Software used :computer:
Python(Pyspark) <br>
SQLite <br>
NLTK package <br>
Google Colab <br>
